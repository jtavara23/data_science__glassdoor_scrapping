Lead Data Scientist,-1,"Why Vacasa

We started with just one home and an idea: to bring homeowners and renters together with smart technology and caring local teams. Today, we're the largest full-service vacation rental company in the US—thanks to the people who give us their best every day. You'll fit right in here if you're curious, entrepreneurial, and thrive in a rapid-growth environment.

Why Product at Vacasa

Our motto is to move fast and dream big. Vacasa is well-resourced and we're going places. Our culture is laid-back but our turnarounds are tight, so we switch gears quickly. You'll innovate and iterate, and your work will make an impact.

What we are looking for

As a machine learning lead at Vacasa, you will provide day-to-day technical leadership and direction to a small team of hard-charging data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts. In addition to tackling your own projects, you'll advise the team on the best modeling techniques to apply, do ""notebook"" and/or code reviews, and set the overall technical direction of our group. This is a great role for a strong individual contributor looking to make a jump to a tech lead position, or a current team lead looking to make the jump to an exciting hyper-growth pre-IPO environment.

What You'll Do

Vacasa is at the sweet spot for machine learning and AI in that we have 1) lots of data (from our 25,000 homes as well as our channel partners and our own guest app and website), 2) problems that require smart software algorithms (pricing 25,000 homes, sending email recommendations to 1 million guests, etc.), and the 3) growth that demands we invest in methods to use 1 to solve 2, and do it quickly.

You'll use your knowledge of data science and machine learning algorithms to help our nimble team solve problems like how we build models to dynamically charge the right price for each of our 25,000 units for each of 540 days into the future, how we rank our units on our search engine results pages in order to maximize guest conversion rate and revenue, and how we estimate how much a prospective home might be able to make as a Vacasa rental based on its characteristics and location. You'll be in jupyter notebooks of your own creation and your colleague's daily, using libraries like Tensor Flow, scikit-learn, pandas, and plotly to build and test models, write up the results, and present findings to key stakeholders. You'll also mentor more junior team members, helping them grow into top-notch data scientists and machine learning engineers.

Skills you'll need
Intelligence, humility, candor, and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and sometimes mildly chaotic startup environment
You like to get things right and ship things quickly, but you can appropriately balance the inherent conflict between the two
Art history majors are welcome -- we are strong believers in personal growth and care more about what you have done at work the past three years and what you are capable of doing now than we do about where you went to school or what you studied
Expert-level SQL - most of our data is in redshift and you should have well-honed skills at accessing it
Strong python experience
Expert-level knowledge of data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, tensor-flow / keras or pytorch, scikit-learn, plotly (or equivalent)
Strong familiarity with a gamut of data science and machine learning approaches, including neural networks, random forest and GBTs, KNNs, k-means clustering, various types of regressions, and bayesian techniques
Ability to function in a ""big data"" environment including an intermediate to expert knowledge of Spark and distributed training
Familiarity with AWS ecosystem and tools such as Glue, SageMaker, Athena, and Fargate
Familiarity with Docker or other container systems
Full english language professional proficiency (Resumes need to be submitted in English)
