Data Engineer,-1,"At BlueLabs we started out last year with the vision of building a next-generation sports betting platform focused on performance, reliability, modularity and automation. After a period of experimentation, we are now excited to see our technology powering the launch of a new B2C operator in Ghana in early 2021.

To ensure the continuous enhancement of our platform while scaling up operations and entering additional African countries, we are now looking into growing our team. As a result, our Data Team is on the lookout for a versatile Data Engineer. With our Data Platform still in its early stages, you’ll have an opportunity to make a huge impact, work on a variety of interesting data-related challenges and help us shape the future of our platform.
The Team
The mission of Data Team is to provide an ecosystem where data is transmitted, stored, processed, served, and analyzed in a fast, stable, reliable, and secure way. As a team, we have the expertise to drive data-related initiatives and make an impact in various parts of the organization.

Our goal is to provide a cutting-edge Data Platform which can be leveraged to explore data, discover insights, build predictive models, and collaborate with other teams on enhancing services. We strive for innovation and promote data-driven solutions which, we believe, will make our products more compelling and give us a competitive advantage on the market. We’re currently building a strong foundation for our platform - well-modelled Data Lake/Warehouse, real-time data ingestion pipelines with scalability in mind, sophisticated observability, and more. This will power our Business Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science initiatives in the future.

As a Data Engineer in our team, you’ll take part in the whole development lifecycle of a product. This involves identifying problems, designing solutions, implementing them, performing code reviews and maintaining services in the production environment. Careful modeling of the data storage layer, ensuring reliable and swift message transfer, building high-performance data pipelines, supporting Analytics and Data Science flows, are just some of the things you’ll face at your day-to-day work. We’re looking for a data generalist who is not afraid of the diverse challenges we will face while building the platform and truly enjoys working with data.

A good candidate should have high standards for himself, a desire to build high-quality, well-tested, production-ready solutions and constantly improve his/her skills. We expect you to take ownership of some parts of the platform, be proactive over the entire development lifecycle and have the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. If this sounds scary, don’t worry - you won’t be alone in this. We value teamwork, trust, communication and a healthy working relationship, so you can always count on the team for support.
About You
You have good problem-solving skills, a tendency towards simple and effective solutions, and a “getting things done” mentality.
Analytical thinking, troubleshooting skills, attention to detail.
You are a reliable, trustworthy person that keeps their promises.
Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new technologies.
Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build.
Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team.
Good communication skills in verbal and written English.
Remote Work
We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.
Compensation
The budgeted compensation range for this role is €58,000 to €64,000 annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor, you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence. In addition to that, we offer a number of perks to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.

As an enterprise producing millions of appliances each year and counting more than 50.000 employees, Electrolux is already generating massive amounts of data in hundreds of systems across the globe from sales to sensors in factory robots or smart home appliances. And with an explosion of IoT devices just around the corner, these data volumes are expected to grow in the near future by an order of magnitude or more.
A typical day

The engineering challenges involved in storing, processing and analyzing data at this scale, velocity and complexity are simply too much for traditional enterprise solutions, so our small team of Data Engineers are currently building a scalable data platform in the cloud to address these challenges and help transform Electrolux into a fundamentally data-driven company.

Who you are

A leader – you have a vision and a purpose, and you can inspire and influence others to not only share it, but apply their abilities to achieving it.
Agile – you work with urgency, analyzing and adapting to different situations, quickly understanding changes and reacting confidently and decisively.
Influential – you have a vision and a purpose, and you can inspire and influence others to not only share it, but apply their abilities to achieving it.
Open – You keep the consumer and customer front of mind, bringing an outside-in perspective to encouraging cross-collaboration, utilizing diversity and encouraging open feedback.
Energetic – Your enthusiasm is infectious and inspires and engages your colleagues and collaborators to achieve, deliver, be accountable and own their work. You’ll also have the stamina essential to delivering results in both the short and long term.

A Stone é uma empresa de soluções financeiras e de tecnologia de pagamentos.
Começamos como uma startup em 2012 e hoje somos a maior adquirente independente do país com mais de 450 mil clientes.
Adotamos uma estratégia diferenciada de vendas e atendimento, com operações próprias em diversas regiões do país para entregar serviço personalizado para quem mais importa, o Cliente.
Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.
Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.
Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.
# Sobre Produtos Financeiros
Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.
Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.
# Sobre o contexto de Dados
A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.
Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 130 mil clientes, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!
Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado à nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!
Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.
Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.
# Sobre o contexto de Dados
A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.
Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 130 mil clientes, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!
Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado à nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!
Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

Senior Data Pipeline Engineer,-1,"WHAT WE DO
Migo is a cloud-based platform that enables companies to offer credit to their consumer and small business customers. Leveraging proprietary datasets, Migo builds ML algorithms on transaction data to assess credit risk then offers credit lines to the companies’ customers. This credit line can be used to make purchases from a merchant or withdraw cash without the need for point-of-sale hardware or plastic cards. Because of our proprietary data and innovative technical solutions, Migo is able to extend credit to underbanked customers who are not typically covered by credit bureaus. Migo is headquartered in San Francisco and currently operates in Nigeria and Brazil.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ROLE
As an experienced data pipeline engineer, we would look to you to design a high-capacity data pipeline architecture as well as design data governance policies while ensuring privacy and security of sensitive data.

- Wrangle with raw data from large, diverse data sets from our distribution partners
- Automate data integrity checks
- Connect our various databases and real-time services to our BI platform

You have a pragmatic approach to building systems, see multiple ways of solving problems, and are able to discuss the tradeoffs of each solution. You are technology agnostic with broad depth and breadth of experience using many different technologies.

HOW WE INTERVIEW AND HIRE
Our interview process begins with an introductory call to help you better understand the opportunity, give us a glimpse into your interests and motivations, and help you decide if Migo is the right place for you to be your happiest and most successful self. From there, we will conduct a technical screen with one of our engineers so you can show us your skills. If all goes well, you will be invited to a virtual onsite to interview with an interview panel from our data science and software engineering teams. Our onsite interview includes 3-4 technical rounds, as well as conversations around what it is like to work at Migo and how you would work with the team on a daily basis. It is designed to assess a broad range of skills so that we can gain a holistic understanding of what you bring to the team and where you shine. We pride ourselves on being transparent throughout the entire interview process with conversations around compensation and the impact you will make here at Migo.

WHY SHOULD YOU WORK AT MIGO?
When you come to work at Migo, you can be assured that your work will be deeply meaningful. You will spend your days solving challenging problems alongside smart and capable colleagues.

A Stone é uma empresa de soluções financeiras e de tecnologia de pagamentos.
Começamos como uma startup em 2012 e hoje somos a maior adquirente independente do país com mais de 450 mil clientes.
Adotamos uma estratégia diferenciada de vendas e atendimento, com operações próprias em diversas regiões do país para entregar serviço personalizado para quem mais importa, o Cliente.
Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.
Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.
Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.
# Sobre Produtos Financeiros
Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.
Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.
# Sobre o contexto de Dados
A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.
Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 35 mil clientes e uma carteira de mais de 400 milhões em crédito, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!
Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado à nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!
Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

# O que você vai fazer
Você fará parte do time de Engenharia de Dados, que é responsável por construir as pipelines de dados que alimentam nosso Datalake, uma parte core da tese do produto de Crédito na Stone. Queremos construir uma arquitetura de dados referência no mercado, e você será peça fundamental nisso. Você participará ativamente na definição da arquitetura das soluções, escolha da stack do projeto e na implementação de fato de tais soluções, garantindo a qualidade técnica e seguindo práticas de mercado.
Principais atividades:
Construção de pipelines de dados de ponta-a-ponta, desde o mapeamento das fontes de dados até a devida distribuição para os times de negócio
Construção de fluxos de processamento de grandes volumes de dados, seja em batch ou streaming
Integração com provedores externos de dados, organização e disponibilização desses dados no Datalake para consumo
Participação ativa na definição dos stacks utilizados nos projetos
Criação de sistemas de controle das rotinas de processamento de dados
# O que buscamos em você

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve.

Senior QA Engineer,-1,"# Sobre a Stone

A Stone é uma empresa de soluções financeiras e de tecnologia de pagamentos.

Começamos como uma startup em 2012 e hoje somos a maior adquirente independente do país com mais de 450 mil clientes.

Adotamos uma estratégia diferenciada de vendas e atendimento, com operações próprias em diversas regiões do país para entregar servio personalizado para quem mais importa, o Cliente.

Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.

Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.

Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.

# Sobre Produtos Financeiros

Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.

Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.

# Sobre o contexto de Dados

A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.

Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 130 mil clientes e uma carteira de mais de 1 bilhão em crédito, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!

Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!

Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

# O que você vai fazer

Você fará parte do time de Engenharia de Dados, que é responsável por construir as pipelines de dados que alimentam nosso Datalake, uma parte core da tese do produto de Crédito na Stone. Queremos construir uma arquitetura de dados referência no mercado, e você será peça fundamental nisso. Você participará ativamente na definição da arquitetura das soluções, escolha da stack do projeto e na implementação de fato de tais soluções, garantindo a qualidade técnica e seguindo práticas de mercado. Também será seu papel auxiliar tecnicamente o resto do time, trazendo padrões de projeto e discutindo ideias com a equipe.

What you’ll achieve


Our data scientists & engineers are helping to shape our marketing strategy for a digital world. The algorithms we build touch all customer segments – consumer, small business, commercial & enterprise. Across the model life cycle we do things at scale, few examples:

1. Feature engineering – Our data sets are 900M x 2K columns. We use spark on Hadoop – we want to make it faster. We also want our team to share features and use the same pipe for train & inference – do we need a feature store?

2. Model train – We use Python & R and we train models on R740 - VMs each with 4 Tesla V100s GPUs. We want to reduce train time, how do we parallelize training for non-deep learning models?

3. Model inferencing – We deploy models in production through containers. Our model output (inferences) are used to drive batch / offline marketing campaigns / operations. We want enterprise app to access model through APIs. We need sub millisecond inferencing – what does the API stack looks like?
