Not required, but a plus:


Today, Twilio powers the delivery of billions of the world's communications. Customer conversations are one of the most informative indicators of a product and business' health. They cover every time a customer was delighted, frustrated, buying more, closing their account, needing help, etc. But usually those conversations are trapped away in a black box, analyzed only by listening to them one by one, or with basic keyword search capabilities.

The Twilio AI team is building a platform that uses machine learning to transcribe, categorise, and extract meaning out of customer conversations so companies can evaluate every one of them and build workflows that automate actions, like prioritizing high value leads to follow up on or identifying customers likely to churn. Our goal is to help companies power more effective business processes and better customer engagement, by understanding the meaning in every conversation.

Twilio is a company that is empowering the world's developers with modern communication in order to build better applications. Twilio is truly unique; we are a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development, and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we're dedicated to helping you develop your strengths.

From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.Visit us at Netskope Careers and follow us on Twitter @Netskope and Facebook.

261,Data Engineer,"At BlueLabs we started out last year with the vision of building a next-generation sports betting platform focused on performance, reliability, modularity and automation. After a period of experimentation, we are now excited to see our technology powering the launch of a new B2C operator in Ghana in early 2021.

To ensure the continuous enhancement of our platform while scaling up operations and entering additional African countries, we are now looking into growing our team. As a result, our Data Team is on the lookout for a versatile Data Engineer. With our Data Platform still in its early stages, you’ll have an opportunity to make a huge impact, work on a variety of interesting data-related challenges and help us shape the future of our platform.
The Team
The mission of Data Team is to provide an ecosystem where data is transmitted, stored, processed, served, and analyzed in a fast, stable, reliable, and secure way. As a team, we have the expertise to drive data-related initiatives and make an impact in various parts of the organization.

Our goal is to provide a cutting-edge Data Platform which can be leveraged to explore data, discover insights, build predictive models, and collaborate with other teams on enhancing services. We strive for innovation and promote data-driven solutions which, we believe, will make our products more compelling and give us a competitive advantage on the market. We’re currently building a strong foundation for our platform - well-modelled Data Lake/Warehouse, real-time data ingestion pipelines with scalability in mind, sophisticated observability, and more. This will power our Business Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science initiatives in the future.

As a Data Engineer in our team, you’ll take part in the whole development lifecycle of a product. This involves identifying problems, designing solutions, implementing them, performing code reviews and maintaining services in the production environment. Careful modeling of the data storage layer, ensuring reliable and swift message transfer, building high-performance data pipelines, supporting Analytics and Data Science flows, are just some of the things you’ll face at your day-to-day work. We’re looking for a data generalist who is not afraid of the diverse challenges we will face while building the platform and truly enjoys working with data.

A good candidate should have high standards for himself, a desire to build high-quality, well-tested, production-ready solutions and constantly improve his/her skills. We expect you to take ownership of some parts of the platform, be proactive over the entire development lifecycle and have the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. If this sounds scary, don’t worry - you won’t be alone in this. We value teamwork, trust, communication and a healthy working relationship, so you can always count on the team for support.
About You
You have good problem-solving skills, a tendency towards simple and effective solutions, and a “getting things done” mentality.
Analytical thinking, troubleshooting skills, attention to detail.
You are a reliable, trustworthy person that keeps their promises.
Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new technologies.
Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build.
Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team.
Good communication skills in verbal and written English.
Remote Work
We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.
Compensation
The budgeted compensation range for this role is €58,000 to €64,000 annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor, you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence. In addition to that, we offer a number of perks to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.

As an enterprise producing millions of appliances each year and counting more than 50.000 employees, Electrolux is already generating massive amounts of data in hundreds of systems across the globe from sales to sensors in factory robots or smart home appliances. And with an explosion of IoT devices just around the corner, these data volumes are expected to grow in the near future by an order of magnitude or more.
A typical day

The engineering challenges involved in storing, processing and analyzing data at this scale, velocity and complexity are simply too much for traditional enterprise solutions, so our small team of Data Engineers are currently building a scalable data platform in the cloud to address these challenges and help transform Electrolux into a fundamentally data-driven company.
You will work as part of the Electrolux Data Science team, a key enabler of the company’s digital agenda and the Groups Center of Excellence with regards to Big Data.
Working alongside both Data Engineers and Data Scientists, your responsibilities include platform work (solution design and implementation of stream processing, ETL and pipeline automation tool chains) as well as concrete pipeline tasks (configuring data flows from source systems to the data lake and/or various lake shore access layer stacks).

As part of the culture of continuous improvement, you will be involved in Lean Thinking projects and activities (EMS/C2W).
Who you are

A leader – you have a vision and a purpose, and you can inspire and influence others to not only share it, but apply their abilities to achieving it.
Agile – you work with urgency, analyzing and adapting to different situations, quickly understanding changes and reacting confidently and decisively.
Influential – you have a vision and a purpose, and you can inspire and influence others to not only share it, but apply their abilities to achieving it.
Open – You keep the consumer and customer front of mind, bringing an outside-in perspective to encouraging cross-collaboration, utilizing diversity and encouraging open feedback.
Energetic – Your enthusiasm is infectious and inspires and engages your colleagues and collaborators to achieve, deliver, be accountable and own their work. You’ll also have the stamina essential to delivering results in both the short and long term.

A Stone é uma empresa de soluções financeiras e de tecnologia de pagamentos.
Começamos como uma startup em 2012 e hoje somos a maior adquirente independente do país com mais de 450 mil clientes.
Adotamos uma estratégia diferenciada de vendas e atendimento, com operações próprias em diversas regiões do país para entregar serviço personalizado para quem mais importa, o Cliente.
Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.
Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.
Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.
# Sobre Produtos Financeiros
Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.
Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.
# Sobre o contexto de Dados
A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.
Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 130 mil clientes, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!
Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado à nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!
Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.
Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.
Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.
# Sobre Produtos Financeiros
Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.
Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.
# Sobre o contexto de Dados
A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.
Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 130 mil clientes, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!
Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado à nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!
Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

Migo is a cloud-based platform that enables companies to offer credit to their consumer and small business customers. Leveraging proprietary datasets, Migo builds ML algorithms on transaction data to assess credit risk then offers credit lines to the companies’ customers. This credit line can be used to make purchases from a merchant or withdraw cash without the need for point-of-sale hardware or plastic cards. Because of our proprietary data and innovative technical solutions, Migo is able to extend credit to underbanked customers who are not typically covered by credit bureaus. Migo is headquartered in San Francisco and currently operates in Nigeria and Brazil.

A Stone é uma empresa de soluções financeiras e de tecnologia de pagamentos.
Começamos como uma startup em 2012 e hoje somos a maior adquirente independente do país com mais de 450 mil clientes.
Adotamos uma estratégia diferenciada de vendas e atendimento, com operações próprias em diversas regiões do país para entregar serviço personalizado para quem mais importa, o Cliente.
Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.
Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.
Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.
# Sobre Produtos Financeiros
Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.
Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro.

# Sobre o contexto de Dados
A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro.

368,Senior QA Engineer,"# Sobre a Stone

A Stone é uma empresa de soluções financeiras e de tecnologia de pagamentos.

Começamos como uma startup em 2012 e hoje somos a maior adquirente independente do país com mais de 450 mil clientes.

Adotamos uma estratégia diferenciada de vendas e atendimento, com operações próprias em diversas regiões do país para entregar servio personalizado para quem mais importa, o Cliente.

Com isso, deixamos de ser uma startup e nos tornamos uma companhia de mais de 6.000 pessoas, unidas por um único sonho: transformar este mercado, trazendo melhores tecnologias, produtos inovadores e um serviço de qualidade para a ponta.

Acreditamos que os nossos clientes merecem ter todas as suas necessidades atendidas com um único ponto de contato em apenas segundos e, por isso, investimos em estratégias que envolvem serviços de adquirência, banking e crédito, além de produtos de software que auxiliam na gestão do negócio de acordo com o segmento do empreendedor.

Nosso dia a dia? Ultrapassar limites, aprender muito e transformar potencial em potência. O seu, o da Stone e o dos nossos Clientes.

# Sobre Produtos Financeiros

Somos uma Business Unit da Stone com a missão de desenvolver e distribuir produtos financeiros que ajudem o nosso cliente a gerenciar o seu negócio e a vender mais. Acreditamos que valores como esforço, estudo, ambição e crença na capacidade do indivíduo em empreender são fundamentais para entregar diariamente a nossa missão.

Nossa área faz parte da estratégia central da Stone e nós acreditamos que, por meio de soluções financeiras de qualidade e com total transparência para nossos clientes, vamos conseguir transformar ainda mais o mercado de pagamentos brasileiro. Aqui, unimos times de Produtos, Tecnologia e Operações de vendas e atendimento, todos próprios, para que juntos consigam dar suporte aos empreendedores, entender suas demandas, pensar em melhorias e disrupções e, assim, trazer inovações que alavanquem os negócios da nossa razão: nossos clientes.

# Sobre o contexto de Dados

A Stone começou sua jornada no mercado de adquirência, as chamadas ""maquininhas"", mas está expandindo seu portfólio para produtos bancários e produtos financeiros, desenhados especialmente para o varejista brasileiro. Uma das maiores dores desse público hoje é o acesso a linhas de crédito e financiamento, seja para comprar mercadoria, seja para investir no seu próprio negócio.

Pensando na dor da nossa principal razão, que é o nosso cliente, estamos construindo do zero um produto de crédito inovador, que se encaixa melhor nas flutuações de faturamento do lojista, e pesa menos no seu bolso. Mesmo com aproximadamente um ano de vida, esse produto já cresceu muito, atingindo um patamar de mais de 130 mil clientes e uma carteira de mais de 1 bilhão em crédito, e com um potencial de sucesso enorme pela frente!!

Porém, sendo um produto de risco, esse sucesso está atrelado nossa capacidade de quantificar o risco, que depende fundamentalmente em sermos excepcionais na obtenção, organização e distribuição de um grande volume de dados!!!

Por conta disso, convidamos você para mergulhar de cabeça nesse desafio com a gente, e construir o estado da arte no que diz respeito a BigData, imerso em um produto que é potência e junto com um time de gigantes!!!

# O que você vai fazer

418,Lead Data Scientist,"Why Vacasa

We started with just one home and an idea: to bring homeowners and renters together with smart technology and caring local teams. Today, we're the largest full-service vacation rental company in the US—thanks to the people who give us their best every day. You'll fit right in here if you're curious, entrepreneurial, and thrive in a rapid-growth environment.

Why Product at Vacasa

Our motto is to move fast and dream big. Vacasa is well-resourced and we're going places. Our culture is laid-back but our turnarounds are tight, so we switch gears quickly. You'll innovate and iterate, and your work will make an impact.

What we are looking for

As a machine learning lead at Vacasa, you will provide day-to-day technical leadership and direction to a small team of hard-charging data scientists, machine learning engineers, and analysts. In addition to tackling your own projects, you'll advise the team on the best modeling techniques to apply, do ""notebook"" and/or code reviews, and set the overall technical direction of our group. This is a great role for a strong individual contributor looking to make a jump to a tech lead position, or a current team lead looking to make the jump to an exciting hyper-growth pre-IPO environment.

What You'll Do

Vacasa is at the sweet spot for machine learning and AI in that we have 1) lots of data (from our 25,000 homes as well as our channel partners and our own guest app and website), 2) problems that require smart software algorithms (pricing 25,000 homes, sending email recommendations to 1 million guests, etc.), and the 3) growth that demands we invest in methods to use 1 to solve 2, and do it quickly.

You'll use your knowledge of data science and machine learning algorithms to help our nimble team solve problems like how we build models to dynamically charge the right price for each of our 25,000 units for each of 540 days into the future, how we rank our units on our search engine results pages in order to maximize guest conversion rate and revenue, and how we estimate how much a prospective home might be able to make as a Vacasa rental based on its characteristics and location. You'll be in jupyter notebooks of your own creation and your colleague's daily, using libraries like Tensor Flow, scikit-learn, pandas, and plotly to build and test models, write up the results, and present findings to key stakeholders. You'll also mentor more junior team members, helping them grow into top-notch data scientists and machine learning engineers.

Skills you'll need
Intelligence, humility, candor, and the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and sometimes mildly chaotic startup environment
You like to get things right and ship things quickly, but you can appropriately balance the inherent conflict between the two
Art history majors are welcome -- we are strong believers in personal growth and care more about what you have done at work the past three years and what you are capable of doing now than we do about where you went to school or what you studied
Expert-level SQL - most of our data is in redshift and you should have well-honed skills at accessing it
Strong python experience
Expert-level knowledge of data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, tensor-flow / keras or pytorch, scikit-learn, plotly (or equivalent)
Strong familiarity with a gamut of data science and machine learning approaches, including neural networks, random forest and GBTs, KNNs, k-means clustering, various types of regressions, and bayesian techniques
Ability to function in a ""big data"" environment including an intermediate to expert knowledge of Spark and distributed training
Familiarity with AWS ecosystem and tools such as Glue, SageMaker, Athena, and Fargate
Familiarity with Docker or other container systems
